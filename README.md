# crazy-cat-lady-boardgame-simulation

Crazy Cat Lady is a basic spin-and-move board game that follows the life of a crazy cat lady as she visits the park, vet, animal shelter, etc., gaining and losing cats along the way. After playing the game with friends, I wanted to simulate games to see if our experiences (landing on the same spaces frequently) were typical, and I wanted to simulate application of some "house rules" to speed up the game.
